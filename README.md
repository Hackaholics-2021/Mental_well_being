ABSTRACT 
 Mental wellness is the need of the hour, with everyone dealing with the  second wave in their own way and with their own struggles due to the lockdown  restrictions and the overall COVID situation. Building a solution specially designed for  front-line workers - healthcare professionals, and law enforcement officers, journalists,  and the like - to keep tabs on their mental health and consult therapists in a single step. 
Frontline workers can take a quiz. Based on the score, the client is directed to Therapist  Consultation and book an appointment on a desired date and time. Both client &  therapist get email regarding Appointment details. 
Frontline workers as well non frontline workers can access this web portal. 
Therapists can Accept/Cancel the appointment and this status is also updated in Client's  page. 

IDENTIFICATION AND JUSTIFICATION OF PROBLEM: 
Frontline health workers are integral to the global response to  
COVID-19. In hospitals, clinics and homes around the world, health workers are taking  on significant personal risk and too often working without adequate equipment to  ensure all of us can receive the care we need. The current crisis is demonstrating the  essential, tireless, innovative and too-often undervalued role of health workers in  ensuring strong systems for everyone, everywhere. We are providing act of support to  provide single step consultation to check on the mental health of these fearless frontline  workers. 

DESCRIPTION: 
Our web portal focuses on the frontline workers on their  
mental health based on separate categories like anger, depression, stress, etc.  Adding on to it we also provided to give consultation for non-frontline workers. 

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM: 
 Firstly the frontline workers or non-frontline workers are assessed  based on the quiz we have given and based on their quiz score we will provide them  consultation to the specialized doctor .Workers can schedule their appointments  with the doctors in their pace of time. There is a status checker where workers can  view their appointment status and we have also provided the option to cancel the  appointment. We have made sure that every single piece of information is kept  confidential .We have used html, css, javascript, bootstrap for the frontend, Jquery  for validation, mysql for the backend. Frontline workers and non-frontline workers  will be the main target group. 

WORKING OF WEBSITE: 
 In home page, we have provided the navigation bar containing  Home, About, Contact, Login Signup nav links. 
Since our website focuses mainly on frontline worker's mental wellbeing, we provide  the assessment link where they can take a quiz to check their mental fitness on  categories like depression, anger, stress, sleeplessness and grief & loss. 
We have provided some categories where the quiz is based on that respective  category, here both frontline and non-front line workers can access the quiz and get  into consultation based on the result. 
We have displayed some info about why mental health is important and when is the  right time to consult, that apparently becomes the about us of our web portal. 
Next at the bottom we have the footer containing nav links and contact details. 
In registration, we provided a form for clients prompting them to enter their name,  email & password. For Therapist, we provided a link to a separate registration page 
where therapist is prompted to enter name, specialization, area of practices, experience and fees.  
After signing up, User is redirected to login page, both clients and therapist can login  here so that they could be redirected to their respective home pages. 
In Client's home page, here we have provided the navigation links for Home, about us, Contact, Your Appointments and Logout. In 'Your appointments', Client can view  the booked appointment details.  
It's in client's hand to take a self-assessment, if he/she is a frontline worker, they can  straight away click on Take assessment, and client could see the frontline workers are  categorised into 12, based on their profession such as Health care workers, Social  workers, Child care, journalists, lawyers & advocates, public safety & national  security, transport, customer care workers, Govt.employees, IT professionals,  Delivery services and Teachers. 
So the client can select the category which they come under and take the quiz. For  instance if Client is a Doctor, they go for health care workers; the client is taken into  quiz where they could choose an appropriate option based on the question. Here the  quiz questions are categorized into Depression, anger, anxiety, stress, sleeplessness  and grief & loss, an analysed set of questions for the circumstances faced by  respective profession in frontline workers. 
After the quiz, it is the result analysis where it displays a score chart containing  different colours indicating the score for each of the above said categories. 
If the score is above average, their mental fitness is super good,  
If the score is below average, they are asked to Book a session if they need to. 
If the score is bad, their mental health is not so good, so we are here suggesting the  consultation with therapist on the particular area where the specific score is low. 
We have also provided a link for self-assessment where client can take quiz on  different areas where they feel their mental strength is weak in particular area. 
Once they click on 'Book a session' button, they redirected to booking page, where  we can filter out Therapists based on our desired choice. In filtration, client can  choose the area from the list containing addiction, anger, anxiety, depression, stress  etc, next client can choose the gender where client feels comfortable to talk with, 
and last is the mode of session where the client can choose among video/chat/voice  mode where consultation can be made virtually. 
Based the selected filters, therapists are listed. In the card, details such as name,  specialization, experience, area of expertise, fees and mode are displayed. The clients  can just simply click on book a session button to make an appointment. 
In Appointment page, where details like Therapist name, area, mode, fees are  automatically provided, only appointment description, date and time slot are  required to enter by the client. After clicking on book appointment button, we  provided a alert message that the appointment has been booked. As soon as after  booking the appointment, both the client and Therapist receives a mail containing  the details of the appointment. Only the therapist gets the email id of the client for  further communication. So the therapist's details are kept confidential, displaying  just their name. 
Furthermore to ensure the booking, client can go to 'Your Appointments' tab, so here  the details of appointment are given such as the name of therapist ,description  status, by clicking view, we could see the additional details like mode, fees & time  slot. 
the status is opened as it is default . If the therapist cancels the appointment due to  their personal timing issues or other reasons, therapist cancels the appointment,  which is reflected here in the status as cancelled. 
In Therapist's home page where the Therapist's username is displayed. And we have  the navigations for Home, Profile, Appointment, Appointment review, Patient survey,  FAQ and Logout. 
In Appointment tabs, the client appointments all together will be displayed. In  Therapist’s home page where we have given more preference for front-line worker's  appointment so by clicking here they can be able to view all the frontline worker's  appointments and giving them more importance. 
We have provided the segment where the areas handled by the doctors are specified  in this carousel. Below we have the appointment review which describes about the  mode of sessions which they have taken so far. So in the Appointments page all the  details of the appointment like the booking Id and Client's name and appointment  description is specified. The status of the appointment is default Open and if the  Therapist wants to view more details of the booking, he or she can click the view  button and all the details of the bookings are displayed in a dialog box. 
Only Therapist can cancel the appointment if he/she is not available at that particular  date or time he/she can cancel the appointment using this cancel button. 
The status of Appointment is updated as cancelled and the same will be reflected in  the client's page also. 
The changes made by the therapist’s booking status are updated as cancelled and the  client can book another appointment in another date also. 

CONCLUSION: 
 Many studies confirm that front line workers are at risk of significant  psychological distress as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The overwhelming  workload, depletion of personal protection, feeling of being inadequately supported  may contribute to mental wellbeing of these workers. We hope that our website will  provide them proper guide and support to make sure that they are in the proper  mental state and provide Therapist consultation in a single step.
